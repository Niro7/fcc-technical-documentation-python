        <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
        <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a class="refer" href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
        <p>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system.</p>

        <p>If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.</p>
        <p>If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.</p>
        <p>Python is just the language for you.</p>

        <p>Python is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a <em>very-high-level language</em>, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.</p>
        <p>Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.</p>

        <p>Some of Python's notable features:</p>
        <li>Uses an elegant syntax, making the programs you write easier to read.</li>
        <li>Is an easy-to-use language that makes it simple to get your program working. This makes Python ideal for prototype development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.</li>
        <li>Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files.</li>
        <li>Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE.</li>
        <li>Can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface.</li>
        <li>Runs anywhere, including <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/" class="refer" target="_blank">Mac OS X</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/" class="refer" target="_blank">Windows</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html" class="refer" target="_blank">Linux</a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html" class="refer" target="_blank">Unix</a>, with unofficial builds also available for <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Android" class="refer" target="_blank">Android</a> and iOS.</li>

        <p>Some programming-language features of Python are:</p>
        <li>A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.</li>
        <li>Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and multiple inheritances.</li>
        <li>Code can be grouped into modules and packages.</li>
        <li>The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in cleaner error handling.</li>
        <li>Python's automatic memory management frees you from having to manually allocate and free memory in your code.</li>
        <p>Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</p>
        <li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
        <li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
        <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>

        <header>First Python Program</header>
        <p>Now that we have Python up and running, we can write our first Python program.</p>
        <p>Let's create a very simple program called <code>Hello World</code>. A <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> is a simple program that outputs <code>Hello, World!</code> on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.</p>
        <p>Type the following code in any text editor or an IDE and save it as <code>hello_world.py</code></p>
        <code>print("Hello, world!")</code>
        <p>Then, run the file. You will get the following output.</p>
        <code>Hello, world!</code>
        </section>
        <section id="Identifiers_&_Keywords" class="main-section">
          <header>Identifiers & Keywords</header>
          <p>A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. It can be of any length. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9). Names like <code>myClass</code>, <code>var_1</code> and <code>print_this_to_screen</code>, all are valid example.</p>
          <p>An identifier cannot start with a digit. <code>1variable</code> is invalid, but <code>variable1</code> is a valid name</p>
          <p>Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, <strong>Fruits</strong> and <strong>fruits</strong> are two different identifiers in Python.</p>
          <p>Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers −</p>
          <li>Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.</li>
          <li>Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.</li>
          <li>Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strong private identifier.</li>
          <li>If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.</li>
          <p>Keywords are the reserved words in Python. You cannot use them as constants or variables or  function names or any other identifier names. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.</p>
          <p>In Python, keywords are case sensitive. All the keywords except <code>True</code>, <code>False</code> and <code>None</code> are in lowercase and they must be written as they are. The list of all the keywords is given below.</p>

          <section id="Statement" class="main-section">
            <header>Statement</header>
            <p>Instructions that a Python interpreter can execute are called statements.</p>
            <p>For example, <code>a = 1</code> is an assignment statement. <code>if</code> statement, <code>for</code> statement, <code>while</code> statement, etc. are other kinds of statements which will be discussed later.</p>
            <p>In Python, the end of a statement is marked by a newline character. But we can make a statement extend over multiple lines with the line continuation character (<code>\</code>). For example:</p>
<pre>
a = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
    4 + 5 + 6 + \
    7 + 8 + 9
</pre>
            <p>This is an explicit line continuation. In Python, line continuation is implied inside parentheses <code>( )</code>, brackets <code>[ ]</code>, and braces <code>{ }</code>. For instance, we can implement the above multi-line statement as:</p>
<pre>
a = (1 + 2 + 3 +
    4 + 5 + 6 +
    7 + 8 + 9)
</pre>
            <p>Here, the surrounding parentheses <code>( )</code> do the line continuation implicitly. Same is the case with <code>[ ]</code> and <code>{ }</code>. </p>
            <p>We can also put multiple statements in a single line using semicolons, as follows:</p>
            <code>a = 1; b = 2; c = 3</code>
          </section>
          <section id="Lines_and_Indentation" class="main-section">
            <header>Lines and Indentation</header>
            <p>Python does not use braces(<code>{}</code>) to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.</p>
            <p>The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount. For example −</p>
<pre>
if True:
    print ("True")
else:
    print ("False")
</pre>
<p>Indentation can be ignored in line continuation, but it's always a good idea to indent. It makes the code more readable. For example:</p>
<pre>
if True:
    print('Hello')
    a = 5
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<code>if True: print('Hello'); a = 5</code>
          </section>
          <section id="Comments_in_Python" class="main-section">
            <header>Comments in Python</header>
            <p>Comments are very important while writing a program. They describe what is going on inside a program, so that a person looking at the source code does not have a hard time figuring it out.</p>
            <p>You might forget the key details of the program you just wrote in a month's time. So taking the time to explain these concepts in the form of comments is always fruitful.</p>
            <p>A hash sign (<code>#</code>) that is not inside a string literal is the beginning of a comment. All characters after the <code>#</code>, up to the end of the physical line, are part of the comment and the Python interpreter ignores them.</p>
<pre>
# First comment
print ("Hello, Python!") # second comment
</pre>
            <p>This produces the following result −</p>
            <code>Hello, Python!</code>
            <p>Python does not have multiple-line commenting feature. You have to comment each line individually as follows −</p>
<pre>
# This is a comment.
# This is a comment, too.
# This is a comment, too.
# I said that already.
</pre>
          </section>
          <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. It means that when you create a variable, you reserve some space in the memory. </p>
            <p>Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to the variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>              
            <p>It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later in the program.</p>
            <p>The equal sign (<code>=</code>) is used to <strong>assign values</strong> to variables. The operand to the left of the <code>=</code> operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the <code>=</code> operator is the value stored in the variable. For example −</p>
<pre>
  counter = 100          # An integer assignment
  miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point
  name    = "John"       # A string
</pre>
            <p>Let's see how we can change the value of a variable:</p>
<pre>
  website = "apple.com"
  print(website)
  
  # assigning a new value to website
  website = "programiz.com"
  
  print(website)
</pre>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre>
  apple.com
  programiz.com
</pre>
            <p>In the above program, we have assigned apple.com to the website variable initially. Then, the value is changed to programiz.com.            </p>
            <p>Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables <em>simultaneously</em>. For Example-</p>
            <code>a = b = c = 1</code>
            <p>The above program assigns the number <code>1</code> to all the three variables a, b and c.</p>
            <p> You can also assign multiple values to multiple variables. For example −</p>
            <code>a, b, c = 5, 3.2, "Hello"</code>
            </section>
            <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
              <header>Data Types</header>
              <p>Every value in Python has a datatype. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.</p>
              <p>Some of the important types are listed below.</p>
              <h3>Numbers</h3>
              <p class="sub_content">Integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers fall under <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/numbers" class="refer" target="_blank">Python numbers</a> category. They are defined as <code>int</code>, <code>float</code> and <code>complex</code> classes in Python.</p>
              <p class="sub_content">We can use the <code>type()</code> function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to. Similarly, the <code>isinstance()</code> function is used to check if an object belongs to a particular class.</p>

            <p class="sub_content">In Python, dictionaries are defined within braces <code>{}</code> with each item being a pair in the form <code>key:value</code>. Key and value can be of any type.</p>
<pre>
>>> d = {1:'value','key':2}
>>> type(d)
