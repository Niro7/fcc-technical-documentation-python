          <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
          <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a class="refer" href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
          <p>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system.</p>

          <p>If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.</p>
          <p>If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.</p>
          <p>Python is just the language for you.</p>

          <p>Python is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a <em>very-high-level language</em>, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.</p>
          <p>Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.</p>

          <p>Some of Python's notable features:</p>
          <li>Uses an elegant syntax, making the programs you write easier to read.</li>
          <li>Is an easy-to-use language that makes it simple to get your program working. This makes Python ideal for prototype development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.</li>
          <li>Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files.</li>
          <li>Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE.</li>
          <li>Can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface.</li>
          <li>Runs anywhere, including Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and Unix, with unofficial builds also available for Android and iOS.</li>

          <p>Some programming-language features of Python are:</p>
          <li>A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.</li>
          <li>Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and multiple inheritances.</li>
          <li>Code can be grouped into modules and packages.</li>
          <li>The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in cleaner error handling.</li>
          <li>Python's automatic memory management frees you from having to manually allocate and free memory in your code.</li>
          <p>Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</p>
          <li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
          <li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
          <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>

          <p>Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays many Linux and UNIX distributions include a recent Python. Even some Windows computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python already installed. If you do need to install Python and aren't confident about the task you can find a few notes on the <a class="refer" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download">BeginnersGuide/Download</a> wiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms.</p>
